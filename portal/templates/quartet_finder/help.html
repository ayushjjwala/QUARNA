		<mark>QUARNA</mark> is a web portal, provides information about Quartets in RNA. Nucleotide base quartets are group of 4 nucleotide bases which interact with each other via base pairing and observed recurrently in different functional RNA molecules. In the present work we have classified quartets according to their belongingness to a particular topological class. A comprehensive nomenclature scheme has been proposed based on topology, identity of the four participating nucleotide bases and geometries of constituent base pairs.<br>
		Web-portal will help RNA researcher to identify and annotate base quartets in a given pdb file and will provide complete lists of different type of quartets present in specified datasets of known RNA structures. Details of different datasets are available <a href="/tnd#datasets" target="_blank">here</a>.

		Figure 1 shows the home page of QUARNA portal. We have implemented some features in QUARNA which help to search base quartets in multiple ways. The functionalities of the 4 sections marked with number 1-4 in figure1 are elaborately described below. At the top QUARNA home page, a navigation bar named Quartet Atlas is available (highlighted in a red square box in Figure 1), where user can get a overview of all available quartet varieties in nature. Separate lists are available for different topologies. Quartet Atlas also provides an idea about occurrence frequency of each quartet type in all four dataset considered in our study.

		User can access Quartet finder program through this section. Here user can mention a pdb file name in the prescribed box (marked as (I) in figure 2), the program will fetch the pdb file directly from RCSB-PDB database and search for quartets in it upon clicking the "Find quartets" button (marked as (III) in figure 2). At the top right corner of the box there is a link for a test example. Clicking on this link a default pdb file “3tvf”will be considered for testing purpose. In figure 2 for example we have chosen the test example. This program may take some time to run completely depending on the size of the pdb file. Once completed two more options named “View” and “Download” will appear beside the find quartet button. If the user already have the pdb file in his/her local system, he/she can upload the file to the server through the browse option given (marked as (II) in figure 2) to get the same results.

		This quartet finder program detects all quartets in the given pdb file and generates four separate output files named as linear.txt, star.txt, cyclic.txt and semi_cyclic.txt for linear, star, cyclic and semi-cyclic topology respectively. These output files contain instances of all the quartets belong to the respective topological classes along with the detailed information about their location (nucleotide numbers and chain names) and base pairing geometries between participant nucleotide bases. The program also annotate each quartets as per our proposed nomenclature rules and report the proper name of each quartet in the same output files.<br>
		<u>Download option</u>: Clicking on to the “Download” option user can download these generated files in .txt format within a zipped folder.  The details of the downloadable output files are described below.<a href="#formats"><sup>[?]</sup></a><br>

		In Figure 2 we have given the pdb file name <i>3tvf</i>, the output will be generated and downloaded as <i>3tvf.zip</i> which can be extracted for further use.<br><br>
		<i>3tvf.zip</i> will contain 12 output files:

		Out of this 12 files 6 files (.out, .cor, .dat, .fasta, .nup, .hlx ) are generated by BPFind program.

The output format in each of the .txt files are explained in <a href="#formats" target="_blank">Section C</a>.<br>
		<u>View option</u>: If the user click onto the “View” option, the same quartet lists which are mentioned above, will appear in a new tab. Before showing the result page a dialogue box will appear, which suggests users to continue script if any warning comes while loading the molecular image in the JSMOL window provided in the view result page.  Figure 3 shows the result page generated by selecting view option. At top left corner of the result page, there are  four separate tab corresponding to four topologies. In figure 3 as the “Linear”tab is selected, the list  below the tab showing different topology names, contains all instances of linear quartets in the pdb file 3tvf. The quartet instances shown in the lists are named according to the proposed nomenclature rules. Here nucleotide numbers of each residues are written before the residue name and chain id is written within a bracket follwing the residue name. In the right hand side JSMOL window initially the whole pdb file will be loaded. Then user can visualize any particular quartet(s) by selecting that/those quartet instances from the list and choosing any one of the three options - “Locate”, “Context”, and “Restrict”, provided just below the list. These options are highlighted within a red box in figure 3.<br>

		Figure 6 is the enlarged view of section 4 shown in Figure 1.  This section provides a topology specific searching option. For example we can go to search in linear quartet tab. Figure 6 represent the searching options provided for linear quartets. In a linear quartet there is one central base pair and two terminal base pairs. Through this search option user can retrieve a list of quartets having a specific base pair either in central or terminal position. User can select two bases from the first two drop down list given, and then can mention a partcular geometry as W:W, W:H etc. In this search also user need to select a dataset.

		In Figure 11 also the first line “----------- 1XJR-----------” denotes the pdb file name in which the following star quartets are observed. In this example 1 quartet is observed named as 1. Cyclic quartet can be represented as the combination of two triples, where terminal bases are shared by both the triples.<br>
		Corresponding to each cyclic-4 quartet, thus there are three lines shown as 1a, 1b and 1c. First two lines (line a and line b) represent the identity and position (nucleotide number and chain id) of participating bases in two triples respectively and the third line (line c) represents the name of the quartet which is assigned by our program as per the proposed nomenclature scheme.<br>
		In figure 11 for line 1a and 1b, column numbers are also given and meaning of each column is described below.<br>
		For line 1a:

		In Figure 12 also pdb file names are mentioned at the top. Then, to represent quartets two lines are mentioned, first one  started with “quad:” and second one started with “triplet:”.<br>
		“Quad:” line is the same as 2b line of star quartet mentioned above. Fist residue of the “quad:” line is the central base of the semi-cyclic quartet.<br>
		“Triplet:” line represent the cyclic triple part of the semi-cyclic quartet, where one of the terminal base of the star quartet (mentioned in “quad” line) is the central base of the triple. The first residue of the “triplet:” line is the central base of the cyclic triple part, which is otherwise one of the terminal base of the quartet.<br>
